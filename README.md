# Automation of seed sowing meachsnism using ESP32 [Mechatronics]


## Overview

This mechatronics based system introduces an innovative idea for seed sowing mechanism that lets its user control the distance between two seeds being dropped without needing to introduce in the physical setup attached at the back of the tractoe. It also features seed dispach pipe blockage detection and level indications for seed tanks.<br>
The code base for this project is developed using Micropython and Arduino.
